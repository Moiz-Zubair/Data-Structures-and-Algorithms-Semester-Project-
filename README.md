If you have ever used a navigation service to find optimal route and estimate time to destination, you have used algorithms on graphs. Graphs arise in various real-world situations as there are road networks, computer networks and, most recently, social networks! If you are looking for the fastest time to get to work, cheapest way to connect set of computers into a network or efficient algorithm to automatically find communities and opinion leaders in Facebook, you're going to work with graphs and algorithms on graphs. Here we will talk about shortest paths algorithms — like Dijkstra’s, Bi-directional, Floyd Warshall which are faster algorithms used in Google Maps and other navigational services.
